# Samsara REST API

> Note: This spec powers our API reference documentation, and is kept up-to-date with our API. This spec is provided as an optional resource for your convenience, but it has not been officially tested for use with code-generation libraries. Samsara frequently updates and refactors this spec to improve our API reference documentation.

This repo hosts [Samsara](https://www.samsara.com)'s [Open API specs](https://swagger.io/specification/v2). See [developers.samsara.com](https://developers.samsara.com) for details on authentication, versioning, and other usage specifics.

## Open API Spec

We use [swagger](https://swagger.io/specification/v2) (also known as Open API) to document our REST APIs. There are two swagger files in this repo:

- `swagger.json`
- `swagger-legacy.json`

Samsara is currently in the process of releasing a new generation of our APIs. You can read more about the new generation [here](https://developers.samsara.com/docs/introducing-our-next-generation-api), but suffice to say that the new generation contains many improvements to the first one.

`swagger.json` should be your go-to reference for Samsara's Open APIs. It contains the most recently released APIs, as well as any legacy APIs necessary to maintain feature parity. You can find the reference documentation [here](https://www.samsara.com/api).

`swagger-legacy.json` is the Open API spec containing all of our legacy APIs, and should only be used if you need to use a legacy API for an old implementation. You can find the reference documentation for this set of APIs [here](https://www.samsara.com/api-legacy).
